# Cross-Domain Sentiment Classification using Vector Embedded Domain Representations

## TODO

- [ ] Find the focus of the paper  
- [ ] Clean up code  
- [ ] Move over preproc  
- [ ] Do prettier preproc  
- [ ] Twitter GloVe  
- [ ] MongoDB
- [ ] More robust testing  
- [ ] More tests  
- [ ] Multiple runs per config  

## Ideas for focus areas

- Beat state of the art in some way (Compute performance?)
- Specialized cases (Scenarios - Data quality)
- Focus on embeddings (Only look at the embeddings and the space that is created)


## Experiments

- Ablation studies (Mainly domains)
- Hyperparameter optimization!
